# Web Interview Questions
This repository has questions, coding challenges and sample answers for the coding challenges for general FE interviewing.

## Coding Challenges
1. Convert the given code (class-components) to Functional Components.
    Follow Up: Avoid unnecessary renders without modifying App's interval

2. Using the given code (dark-mode) add support for "Dark Mode"
  Dark Mode should make it so the background is Dark and Fonts contrast with it
  Try using as little JS as possible

3. Create a full CRUD for a Notes application (notes has a JSON server with the structure).
  Each part should have its own screen (Creation, Editing, Details)
  Delete can just be a modal (or a separate screen)
  There should be an "All Notes" view
  Should use Redux to handle state and changes
